# Stock-Price-Prediction
In this project, I use Panda Reader to get historical stock prices for a particular stock (I chose Apple in this example but it could be modified to look at any stock) from Yahoo Finance, for a set date range.
I used the close prices to train a LSTM model, then used the model to predict future prices.
